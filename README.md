# KDE Neon Quick Application Installer

Since I install at least once or twice a year a system (laptop, desktop, VM) from scratch and since I am very lazy installing everything by hand I wrote this little dead simple shell script that installs the programs I use most in [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/).

Of course it could be used just a long list with applications to install and loop over this list, but I rather like to have sorted everything into separate files so that the review of the programs can be done easily.

## Applications

- Eclipse
- CMake
- Visual Studio Code
- Skype
- Microsoft Teams
- Slack

- ...
